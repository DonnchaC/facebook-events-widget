Facebook Events Widget
======================

Wordpress plugin used on Pirates.ie for displaying any upcoming events from our Facebook page. This is forked from the Facebook Events Plugin at https://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook-events-widget/.

This includes pretty hacky modifications for our use to pull and display the event cover photos amongst other info such as the number of people attending.
